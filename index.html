<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
  by teaching them basic lab skills for computing
  like program design, version control, data management, and task automation.
  This two-day hands-on bootcamp will cover basic concepts and tools;
  participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
